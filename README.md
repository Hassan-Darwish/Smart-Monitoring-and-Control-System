# Smart Monitoring and Control System

The Smart Monitoring and Control System is an embedded system designed for real-time environmental monitoring. It utilizes multiple sensors to measure temperature, light intensity, and flame presence, providing automated control of actuators such as a fan, LEDs, and a buzzer. This system is ideal for safety-critical environments, offering efficient monitoring and response.

## Features

1. **Multi-Sensor Monitoring**:
   - Temperature, light intensity, and flame detection.
   - Real-time display on a 16x2 LCD.

2. **Actuator Control**:
   - **Fan**: Automatically adjusts speed based on temperature.
   - **LEDs**: Change states depending on light intensity levels.
   - **Buzzer**: Alerts users to critical flame detection.

3. **Dynamic Alerts**:
   - Flame detection triggers a buzzer and an LCD alert.
   - Fan operation status is displayed on the LCD.

4. **Customizable Thresholds**:
   - Temperature and light intensity thresholds can be adjusted in the code.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - All modules (ADC, PWM, LCD, etc.) are initialized.

2. **Monitoring and Control**:
   - Sensors continuously send data to the microcontroller.
   - Actuators respond dynamically based on sensor inputs:
     - Fan speed adjusts with temperature.
     - LEDs change based on light intensity.
     - Buzzer activates for flame detection.

3. **Real-Time Feedback**:
   - Sensor readings and system status are displayed on the LCD.

## Code Overview

The code is written in C and uses AVR libraries for hardware interfacing:

- **Sensor Input**:
  - ADC reads analog signals from LM35 and LDR sensors.
  - Flame sensor provides digital input.

- **Actuator Control**:
  - PWM controls the DC motor speed.
  - GPIO controls LEDs and the buzzer.

- **LCD Display**:
  - Displays real-time sensor readings and system alerts.

- **Custom Functions**:
  - `ADC_init`, `LCD_init`, `FLAME_SENSOR_getValue`, etc., manage hardware-specific tasks.
  - Threshold values are defined in `main.h`.
